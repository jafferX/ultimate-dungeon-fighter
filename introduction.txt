Welcome to Ultimate Dungeon Fighter! The text based game!

[General Rules]
-A map is displayed, with the current room that you are in.
-You enter which room you want to go into next.
-You may only move up and down, left and right.
-The boss is located in room 9.
-If you have not visited a room yet, you will encounter a monster.
-Upon defeating the monster, you will get an increase in stats (health, attack, and defense).
-If you have already visited a room, then nothing happens, and you proceed.

[During battles]
-Battles will be a turn based fight.
-When it is your turn, you will have three choices:

1. Attack
2. Defend
3. Special Attack
4. Heal

-You will type in the number with the corresponding move.
-If an input is entered incorrectly, the your turn is skipped.
-You may only activate the special attack after two turns.
-The longer you hold off on activating the special attack, the stronger it is.
-If you did not wait two turns, your turn will be skipped entirely.
-Do note that your special attack recharges every two turns, and resets each time you face a new monster.
NOTE: Monsters do not have a special attack, however, the boss does, so be careful!
NOTE: It is possible to do negative damage on the monster (heal the monster), should their defense be greater than your attack.

[Game Over]
The game ends in one of two ways:

1. Health drops to zero in a fight
2. You reach the boss room, and you beat it.

NOTE: It is recommended to go through all the rooms until you reach the boss room!
However, if you want a challenge, then you may proceed to the boss room as fast as possible.

Good luck!
